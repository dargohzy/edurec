# CS3240 Assignment - HTML & CSS

Hi there.

The following is my assignment done for my module **CS3240 Interaction Design**. For this assignment, I had to utilise HTML & CSS to create a prototype of my high fidelity
prototype in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xHPwcLvvCNATjHN41Mfd5c/EduRec?node-id=0%3A1). It consists of the following pages:

1. Dashboard.html
2. Academics.html
3. Modreg.html
